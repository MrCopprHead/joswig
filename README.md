# joswig
Joswig algorithm implementation in Python for Parametric Shortest Path Algorithms. Based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01082.pdf

joswig.py contains the main code that implements the joswig algorithm.

joswig_binary.py contains the alternative code that implements the binary method for approximating solutions to the parametric shortest path problem.

joswig_dijkstra.py contains an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and is a dependency for both joswig.py and joswig_binary.py
